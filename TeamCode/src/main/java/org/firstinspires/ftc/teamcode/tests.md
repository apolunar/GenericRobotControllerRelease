 - localization test
   - get relative robot position from odo subsystem and compare to user-entered relative robot position
 - static variable persistence test
   - not necessarily through junit as this tests whether an assigned static variable persists through opmode stops and starts
   - this functions to ensure the robot knows what state it stopped in autonomous so it can pick up in mid/endgame
